# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can find this application live on [React-Feedback-App](https://react-feedback-application.netlify.app/)

It keeps refreshing because it is fetching the feedback data from json-server which is installed locally, but it should work fine when you install it.
